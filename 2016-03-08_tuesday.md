### [Cant-Wait-for-Perfect-Implementing-Good-Enough-Digital-Preservation](http://2016.code4lib.org/Cant-Wait-for-Perfect-Implementing-Good-Enough-Digital-Preservation)

presenters from UCLA & JFK Presidential Library

3 principles:
- bit preservation
- content management
- ongoing accessibility

active, continuous process

multiple copies

add dig-pres to mission-statement

meta archive [20-questions](https://www.metaarchive.org/cost-questions)

['copter' wiki](http://coptr.digipres.org/Main_Page)

[ndsa levels of preservation](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/activities/levels.html) -- good slide

those levels don't address 'access' -- sometimes overlooked due to privacy/cost

ucla person added accessibility levels -- should look at these

### [Facilitating-Interdisciplinary-Web-Archive-Collaboration](http://2016.code4lib.org/Enabling-Access-to-Old-WuTang-Clan-Fan-Sites-Facilitating-Interdisciplinary-Web-Archive-Collaboration)

[WARC file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive) - [dig-pres site](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000236.shtml)

they're working on (http://webarchives.ca/)

wow -- couldn't write a history of the 1990s or beyond without web-archives

could study late sixties only 20 years later -- we're now at that point for the 90's

people working on providing access to web-archives -- wayback machine hard

danger of 'black-box' ranking search results in ways we don't understand

so nick...

warcs rule everything around us

platforms:
- [shine](https://github.com/ukwa/shine/) -- tool that visualizes indexed warcs
    - can do search, see graphs and summary results and click right to web pages

[warcbase](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase) -- open-source platform for managing web-archives -- take a directory of warcs and run analysis
- [one summary](https://library.columbia.edu/content/dam/librarywebsecure/behind_the_scenes/web_resource_collection/warcbase-p1-revised.pdf)

### [dig pres 101](http://2016.code4lib.org/Digital-Preservation-101-or-How-to-Keep-Bits-for-Centuries)

[OAIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System) open archival info system -- from NASA

- Provenance
- Original order -- order matters

how to deal with that in a digital realm?  (something better than nothing)

ebay is the digital archivist's friend

sip -- submission info package

premis

ndiip -- original format sustainability

aip -- archival info package

multiple copies in multiple locations

monitor
- storage quality
- file-formats
- storage obsolesence

dip
- dissemination info package

accessing that content

mess.org -- emulation

more info -- tpverso.wordpress.com

### [Guerrilla-Usability-Testing](http://2016.code4lib.org/Guerrilla-Usability-Testing-and-Communicating-Value)

by [egrguric](http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#ekatarina-eka-grguric)

usability is a quality-attribute

making sure something works well -- Krug

how to test?

task-based usability testing -- use in mid-design state -- somewhere between a low-fidelity prototype and finished design

give real-life user task to complete -- tell them to think out loud

guerilla vs standard testing -- minimal equipment -- 3-6 participants "recruit loosely and grade on a curve"

good test: give user task, don't guide them

2 facilitators, talker and notetaker

silverback is popular and inexpensive -- screen recording

user in comfortable position

3-6 participants, doing 3-4 tasks each

be informative and friendly -- don't introduce prompts

no: maybe you should try logging out? -- yes: can you tell me what you're trying to do or expecting now?

quickly summarize key findings / some action items
- who tested
- what were the tasks?
- missed, misunderstood, misused

value communication -- importance of letting stakeholders know how this supports work

share documents and data

blog about process

do mini-presentations -- be brief and summarize main points

resources -- don norman

### [Web Accessability](http://2016.code4lib.org/Growing-Accessibility-Advanced-Web-Accessibility-Coding-and-User-Testing-for-Libraries)

by [Kate Lynch](http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#katherine-lynch)

basic: low-hanging fruit...

- image alt text
- lists
- ordered headings

other
- walls of text into smaller blocks
- color contrast
- alternatives to rich media

html5 semantics
- section header article figure figurecaption

aria - accesible rick internet applicaitons
- [spec](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwj8sZqYw7HLAhXD4SYKHaEEC74QFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FWAI%2Fintro%2Faria&usg=AFQjCNGWyOGKcRms4bTSajmGYqXR8zaSYA&sig2=qLfflEaYRGFZ4T_dPkHb1g)

roles
states & properties

aria-live="polite" "assertive" "off"

w/o that, dynamic content won't be related to user

'aria-relevant'

must--should--additionally-can -- prioritizing

### [The-Fancy-Finding-Aid](http://2016.code4lib.org/The-Fancy-Finding-Aid-Makeover-your-Collections-with-HTML5-Responsive-Design-RDFa-Circulation-Management-and-Visual-Content)

by (http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#allison-jai-o-dell) and (http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#steven-duckworth)

- googleability
- fast searching
- gis
- new wording: what this is about -- rather that what this is a collection of

finding aids
- ead3
- html5
- responsive design
- rdf & linked-data
- digitization initiatives

because of ead being xml and using xslt into html, those are big technolgies for archivists

updated finding aid can not just provide an index, but also show cool info

swipebox, touchable jquery lightbox -- "tinder for archives"

circulation management --  simplecart.js -- they can just put in email address and the day they want to come by the archive to look at something

focus: front-end technologies for finding aids

### [Spreadsheets](http://2016.code4lib.org/Ever-to-Excel-Towards-an-Apologetics-of-the-Spreadsheet-On-and-Off-the-Web)

by [Mark](http://2016.code4lib.org/Ever-to-Excel-Towards-an-Apologetics-of-the-Spreadsheet-On-and-Off-the-Web)

idea that programmer annoyance at spreadsheets is... ungenerous

spreadsheet = data + program

### [reconciliation](http://2016.code4lib.org/Get-Your-Recon)

by (http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#christina-harlow)

Linked Open Data (LOD) Refine -- fork of OpenRefine

Reconciliation
- Thinks/URIs => Things/URIs

Entity Resoultion
- Strings/Labels <=> Things/URIs

Lexicalization
- Things/URIs <=> Strings/Labels

--

MarcEdit has a linked-data tool

linked data fragment servers -- what are those?

api querying to improve string to thing matching
- example logic flow for personal names

question: how are scores calculated? What's an example of a 90?

### [Build-your-own-identity-hub](http://2016.code4lib.org/Build-your-own-identity-hub)

[Ted](http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#ted-lawless)

Motivation:

Berners-Lee...
stuff on web
available structured
non-proprietery
uris to denote things
link your data to other data to provide context

Why hasn't the linking happened?
- it's difficult and time-consuming; no clear immediate benefit; overwhelming

Process
- id important collection
- match data to central source
- 3-5?

WikiData

Tools
-ldf.vivo -- linked-data fragment server
- rdflib, csvkit, petl, fuzzywuzzy
- karma
- linkeddatafragments.org
- vivo

### [Trust](http://2016.code4lib.org/Why-should-you-trust-my-data-Building-data-infrastructure-that-accommodates-networks-of-trust)

by [Matt](http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#matt-zumwalt)

Rhythm to the computing world
- centralization - decentralization

move toward referencing representations of ourselves

- 2012 2.5 zetabytes
- 2106, 10.4
- 2019, 507.5

- authority & reputaion
- integrity & provenance
- synergy & compatibility
- consistency

datjawn.com from dat-data.com

tide is already turning toward distributed, non-centralized cloud computing

- "csv on the web"

- check out wikidata
