### [linked open dime novels](http://2016.code4lib.org/Linked-Open-Dime-Novels-or-19th-Century-Fiction-and-21st-Century-Data)
by (http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#demian-katz) and (http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#matthew-short)

- 5-10 cents each mid-19th C.
- bibliographic nightmares -- eg different pseudonyms shared by several real-world authors

- started with ontology work -- creativework, edition, copy and series
- [dimenovels.org](https://dimenovels.org) (demian)
- [rda unconstrained](http://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/u/#)

- pseudonym issue: dime:HasCredit -> dimenovels.org.name, and then the dimenovels.org.name is related to foaf

- dimenovels.org built on [geeby-deeby](https://github.com/demiankatz/Geeby-Deeby)

- demian: easy to get away with not knowing much about underlying html technologies -- eg content-negotiation -- really encourages us to learn about them tho.

- both mods and marc to allow for uris associated with strings

- duplicate work of reconciliation not bad -- helps expose data issues

- wrote/used [Murpoint](https://github.com/FalveyLibraryTechnology/Murpoint) "...tool was created to harvest all RDF from a specific domain..."

- used [ARC2](https://github.com/semsol/arc2), php/mysql library and triplestore

- example of underlying rdf, search, then go to an item, eg (https://dimenovels.org/Item/3921/Show), and replace Show with RDF, (https://dimenovels.org/Item/3921/RDF)

### [semantic search](http://2016.code4lib.org/Beyond-the-Keyword-Creative-Search-and-Query-Expansions-based-on-DBpedia)

- synonyms

- semantic keywords

- dbpedia.org/Page/School -- that doesn't work; explore

- child computer-game example
    - child -> teenager
    - computer-game -> video game

- case study: fashion design -- brainforks:8080/creativebook/Fashion_design -- try later
    - showed example of overdrive covers for different categories
    - some outliers

- use breadcrumbs so user knows where stuff's coming from

- example of serendipity/discovery eg getting from iv to camelback

- how many is too many alternates? says amazon gets a sweet-spot of 8-10, oclc shows too many

- need to filter, keeping only most relevant results -- google ngram, she uses python & restful api
     - new words underrepresented, like `email`, or scientific terms
     - :8080/getfreq/[["1gram"]],more -- is that really a part of the url -- ted thinks yes -- check that out

- fault tolerance
    - lemmas
    - capitalization
    - Singplu

- github, [Minervax](https://github.com/minervax/)

### [doing rdf](http://2016.code4lib.org/So-You-Think-You-Want-to-Migrate-to-RDF)

by eben & steven

- focusing on predicates

- which vocab to decide on?
    - vocabs get their value from reuse

- [linked open vocabularies](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/)
- same as

- domain and range...

- range
    - extent example in marc -- might do a lookup and think you could use the extent element they showed -- but the doc for that shows that it expects certain structured data not good for you.
    - so, what if others are using it anyway in a non-compliant way?
    - mint your own or use a less-used one?

- domains
    - latest thinking is that these mean very little -- i'm confused... everyone says, like demian, you get this as you really work on it
    - extinction can happen -- may still need to store stuff locally

- minting predacates
    - (http://opaquenamespace.org)

- xml to rdf can be tricky -- they gave an einstein example

- change thinking from record to relational-database model

- orderedness -- how to deal with that in rdf?
    - eg name-order predicate concept they're thinking about

- performance
    - one example, one-request every 3 seconds
    - solution is caching
    - rails -- using linked-data-fragments to caching layer -- caveat, not latest data

- oregon digital vocab manager

- conclusions -- is it worth it?
    - painful
    - users won't see difference
    - rdf doesn't auto-make it more shareable
    - "maybe"

### [catalogers](http://2016.code4lib.org/How-not-to-waste-catalogers-time-Making-the-most-of-subject-headings)

by (http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#john-mark-ockerbloom)

- specifying subjects -- priority, relatedness

- loc example

- solr not sole solution

- tricky to explore laterally

- he includes, in sorting logic, subject-heading awareness -- also more recent is priviledged, assuming more knowledge

- one goal: link terms that people search for, like 'battle of germantown' -- with lc subject headings -- via indirect lookups like in the semantic search talk
    - me, thought... what if search terms like 'battle of germantown' could be treated as rdf entites... what would that offer? if we had a local ted-ish identity-hub, what could link to that search term? if lc contains that subject-heading, we could include that -- if wikipedia contains that specific subject-heading, we could include that. ok. so what does that then allow...
        - tl: we could bump results by number of wikipedia edits -- popularity -- or at least depth of interest/knowledge
        - tl: easyb data to help determine popularity
            - me: easyA article data for popularity of related articles
        - we could bump results base on the number of links available -- loc, wikipedia, etc
        - we could display alternate/related issues by querying
        - maybe we only care about the most popular search terms for this

- gives example of how blmatter term doesn't exist in lc, but does in wikipedia.

- #mashcat -- how catalogers and coders can work better together

### [burnout](http://2016.code4lib.org/The-Modern-Day-Sisyphus-libtech-Burnout-and-You)

by (http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#becky-yoose)

- managers, make it safer
    - give agency to staff
    - push back when team asked to do too much (eg asking whether a or b should be cut)
    - refer staff to other resources they may need

- be aware that privilege plays a big role in being able to take advantage of opportunities that others provide
    - so look for ways to make opportunities available to less privileged
