### [linked open dime novels](http://2016.code4lib.org/Linked-Open-Dime-Novels-or-19th-Century-Fiction-and-21st-Century-Data)
by (http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#demian-katz) and (http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#matthew-short)

- 5-10 cents each mid-19th C.
- bibliographic nightmares -- eg different pseudonyms shared by several real-world authors

- started with ontology work -- creativework, edition, copy and series
- [dimenovels.org](https://dimenovels.org) (demian)
- [rda unconstrained](http://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/u/#)

- pseudonym issue: dime:HasCredit -> dimenovels.org.name, and then the dimenovels.org.name is related to foaf

- dimenovels.org built on [geeby-deeby](https://github.com/demiankatz/Geeby-Deeby)

- demian: easy to get away with not knowing much about underlying html technologies -- eg content-negotiation -- really encourages us to learn about them tho.

- both mods and marc to allow for uris associated with strings

- duplicate work of reconciliation not bad -- helps expose data issues

- wrote/used [Murpoint](https://github.com/FalveyLibraryTechnology/Murpoint) "...tool was created to harvest all RDF from a specific domain..."

- used [ARC2](https://github.com/semsol/arc2), php/mysql library and triplestore

- example of underlying rdf, search, then go to an item, eg (https://dimenovels.org/Item/3921/Show), and replace Show with RDF, (https://dimenovels.org/Item/3921/RDF)


---

### [semantic search](http://2016.code4lib.org/Beyond-the-Keyword-Creative-Search-and-Query-Expansions-based-on-DBpedia)

- synonyms

- semantic keywords

- dbpedia.org/Page/School -- that doesn't work; explore

- child computer-game example
    - child -> teenager
    - computer-game -> video game

- case study: fashion design -- brainforks:8080/creativebook/Fashion_design -- try later
    - showed example of overdrive covers for different categories
    - some outliers

- use breadcrumbs so user knows where stuff's coming from

- example of serendipity/discovery eg getting from iv to camelback

- how many is too many alternates? says amazon gets a sweet-spot of 8-10, oclc shows too many

- need to filter, keeping only most relevant results -- google ngram, she uses python & restful api
     - new words underrepresented, like `email`, or scientific terms
     - :8080/getfreq/[["1gram"]],more -- is that really a part of the url -- ted thinks yes -- check that out

- fault tolerance
    - lemmas
    - capitalization
    - Singplu

- github, [Minervax](https://github.com/minervax/)

### [doing rdf](http://2016.code4lib.org/So-You-Think-You-Want-to-Migrate-to-RDF)

by eben & steven

- focusing on predicates

- which vocab to decide on?
    - vocabs get their value from reuse

- [linked open vocabularies](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/)
- same as

- domain and range...

- range
    - extent example in marc -- might do a lookup and think you could use the extent element they showed -- but the doc for that shows that it expects certain structured data not good for you.
    - so, what if others are using it anyway in a non-compliant way?
    - mint your own or use a less-used one?

- domains
    - latest thinking is that these mean very little -- i'm confused... everyone says, like demian, you get this as you really work on it
    - extinction can happen -- may still need to store stuff locally

- minting predacates
    - (http://opaquenamespace.org)

- xml to rdf can be tricky -- they gave an einstein example

- change thinking from record to relational-database model

- orderedness -- how to deal with that in rdf?
    - eg name-order predicate concept they're thinking about

- performance
    - one example, one-request every 3 seconds
    - solution is caching
    - rails -- using linked-data-fragments to caching layer -- caveat, not latest data

- oregon digital vocab manager

- conclusions -- is it worth it?
    - painful
    - users won't see difference
    - rdf doesn't auto-make it more shareable
    - "maybe"

### [catalogers](http://2016.code4lib.org/How-not-to-waste-catalogers-time-Making-the-most-of-subject-headings)

by (http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#john-mark-ockerbloom)

- specifying subjects -- priority, relatedness

- loc example

- solr not sole solution

- tricky to explore laterally

- he includes, in sorting logic, subject-heading awareness -- also more recent is priviledged, assuming more knowledge

- one goal: link terms that people search for, like 'battle of germantown' -- with lc subject headings -- via indirect lookups like in the semantic search talk
    - me, thought... what if search terms like 'battle of germantown' could be treated as rdf entites... what would that offer? if we had a local ted-ish identity-hub, what could link to that search term? if lc contains that subject-heading, we could include that -- if wikipedia contains that specific subject-heading, we could include that. ok. so what does that then allow...
        - tl: we could bump results by number of wikipedia edits -- popularity -- or at least depth of interest/knowledge
        - tl: easyb data to help determine popularity
            - me: easyA article data for popularity of related articles
        - we could bump results base on the number of links available -- loc, wikipedia, etc
        - we could display alternate/related issues by querying
        - maybe we only care about the most popular search terms for this

- gives example of how blmatter term doesn't exist in lc, but does in wikipedia.

- [mashcat](http://www.mashcat.info) -- how catalogers and coders can work better together

### [burnout](http://2016.code4lib.org/The-Modern-Day-Sisyphus-libtech-Burnout-and-You)

by (http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#becky-yoose)

- managers, make it safer
    - give agency to staff
    - push back when team asked to do too much (eg asking whether a or b should be cut)
    - refer staff to other resources they may need

- be aware that privilege plays a big role in being able to take advantage of opportunities that others provide
    - so look for ways to make opportunities available to less privileged

---

### lightning talks

- idea for simplifying collection of libanalytics
    - push-button device sends signal to raspberry pi to macro
    - other uses: 'how are we doing?', 'need backup'

- ANTS -- transferring digital records to the archive
    - greg wiedman
    - ants is a python app
    - runs checksums, does some checks, records paths, creates a baggit bag, and transfers now
    - desktop needed for checksums
    - authentication useful

- [Lentil](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/lentil), by NCSU libraries
    - instagram api changes, which require users to have to give permission to folk to use those images via the api
    - can get key for exemption from public api requirements
    - submission requirements for instagram -- be specific (valid use-cases that reflect their issues), persistent, lucky
    - sample api submission box

- kate deibel
    - sharing pieces of things difficult
    - dissecting code takes skill
    - don't share as monolithic repository
    - share independent components
    - show/handled dependencies
    - easy customization & deployment
    - orbiscascade.org -- working on primo software toolkit

- michael gibney
    - [xmlaminar](https://github.com/upenn-libraries/xmlaminar) -- tool for working with arbitrarily large amounts of xml

- doi into core metadata
    - michael berkowski
    - [link](https://z.umn.edu/introduction.php)
    - content-negotiation crash course
    - provide 'Accept' http request header to ask for josn, xml, etc -- comma separated list -- can give preferential treatment
    - dx.doi.org, `Accept: application/citeproc+json`
    - must follow location redirects
    - examine returned content-type

- quicksearch now opensource
    - kevin beswick, ncsu -- ncsu single-search platform
    - single-search, bento-box search based on rails
    - vagrant, ansible-playbooks
    - modular & extensible
    - statics & best-bets
    - uses searchers -- based on gems that are easy to write

- [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) for documentation
    - [AtoM](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/) development documentation was problematic
    - write in [restructured text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)
    - me: can convert from restructured text to markdown via [pandoc](http://pandoc.org)

- justin from gwu
    - programming and software development consultation services
    - scheduled in 30 minute blocks -- using scheduling software
    - list of what's in scope -- pretty broad
    - out of scope: cs assignments, not TAs or tutoring -- referrals
    - why: want to support scholarship -- forces them to get out of cubes and talk to real people
    - results for 3 months(?)
        - there is a demand
        - setting up github pages
        - how to prepare for tech interview
        - raising their team's visbility

- [RMap](http://rmap-project.info/rmap/)
    - portico -- karen hanson?

[Janus](http://2016.code4lib.org/Janus-Nodejs-Handler-for-all-Library-Searches)

by [david-naughton](http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#david-naughton) -- u.of minnesota

- [Janus](https://github.com/mozilla/node-janus)

- small application; doesn't do much

- common problem
    - many search targets
    - gathering statics on library usage -> trying to correlate with student success/value

- one solution, bento box, like ncsu; jonathan has one too

- one handler to rule all search forms

- search forms  -->  janus  --> targets
    - so janus can gather searches

- benefits
    - single code-base to maintain
    - automate deletion of search data

- url api -- x/janus?search=darwin

- challenges setting it up
    - [guzzle](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/) http library -- but had problems with javascript
    - nodejs installation
    - asynchrony

- node.js for testing
    - not rubust http sever, need referse proxy, nginx
    - for daemon, forever or supervisor
    - they used apache & passenger
        - he has an undocumented configuration

- Angular
    - popular
    - databinding
    - good testing
    - MVC
    - the [styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) they use
    - architecture
        - querybuilder-service, search-service, savedrecord-service, data-service, storage-service

- Elasticsearch
    - scales
    - did their own mapping
    - art example
    - interesting UI -- intead of eliminating zero-length facets -- show/unshow checkboxes to indicate what's `active`

### [creative disintegration](http://2016.code4lib.org/Constructive-disintegration-reimagining-the-library-platform-as-microservices)

by [sebastian-hammer](http://2016.code4lib.org/speakers.html#sebastian-hammer)

- ils via microservices

- stars with empty box

- 'app store' (incubator/makerspace)
    - catalog
    - patrons
    - circ
    - e+p acq

- intitial research library focus
    - citations?
    - inst.repository
    - publishing platform
    - other
        - plugins

- common UI layer -- initially based on react

- storage layers:
    - metadata, users, items, KB
    - if someone wants to use a different db or a triple-store, they can

- language
    - agnostic
    - microservices
    - restful interactions
    - focus on the interface
    - possibility of pieces hosted by different entities

- me:
    - what's the vetting for something being in the app store?
        - thought: no hardcoded urls, so user can be sure of no hidden calls
        - hmmn... if focus is on interfaces -- i could imagine a propritary vendor offering one of the pieces hosted that's closed-source, that culls data -- which would be ok -- as long as there are other kinds of app-store options

- microservices-ISH -- what's that?

- x likes angular over backbone
- yeoman and jenkins -- so deployment's easy

- every application state is stored in the url

- proxy layer, api in front of api, to handle authentication initially, but now other things too
    - query/cache taxonomy
    - query taxonomy
    - running bulk updates
    - get/set user prefs
    - other things were listed

- mysql query: 1 minute
- dynamoBD/Elastic ingestion: 1 hour.

- lesson-learned: stakeholders focus on UI, not API, important to manage expectations
